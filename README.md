# Blender_Scripts
Scripts for performing  various functions within Blender 2.8-3.3
There is no organization. Testing done with 3.3 LTS on most scripts.
These are for specific purposes and are not always reusable without modification.
Most are 100% my own code. Some are adaptations from code discovered elsewhere. When the source author was known, I have included credit.

There is little to no error checking, so if a script fails be sure to read the error description carefully.
Scripts dealing with materials are presuming the use of a Principled BSDF node.
Be aware that the Blender Foundation routinely makes changes to Blender. This can impact any script from working across all versions.
If you have an issue with any of my scripts, please let me know.
