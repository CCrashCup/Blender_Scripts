# Blender_Scripts
Scripts for performing  various functions within Blender 2.8-3.3
There is no organization. Testing done with 3.3 LTS on most scripts.
These are for specific purposes and are not always reusable without modification.
Most are 100% my own code. Some are adaptations from code discovered elsewhere. When the source author was known, I have included credit.
